Here are the main steps that you need to follow:</p> <p>Create a configuration file for FCLite API, which contains the information about the server URL, the access token, the log level, and the log file path. You can use the sample configuration file provided by Gehtsoft USA LLC here: https://docs.gehtsoftusa.com/fclite/#configuration.html Load the configuration file in your code using the FCLite API methods for your language. For example, if you use C++, you can use the method FXCM::Config::load(const char* fileName) to load the configuration file from a given file name. Create a session object for FCLite API, which represents a connection to the FXCM trading platform. You can use the FCLite API methods for your language to create and manage the session object. For example, if you use C++, you can use the method FXCM::Session::create() to create a session object. Use the session object to perform various trading operations with FCLite API, such as logging in, logging out, subscribing to market data, placing orders, modifying trades, retrieving historical data, and more. You can use the FCLite API methods for your language to access and manipulate the session object. For example, if you use C++, you can use the method FXCM::Session::login() to log in to the FXCM trading platform using the session object.

It has two parts: a stop price and a limit price. The stop price is the level that activates the order. The limit price is the level that executes the order.</p> <p>For example, suppose you want to buy EUR/USD at 1.2000, but you don't want to pay more than 1.2050. You can place a stop limit order with a stop price of 1.2000 and a limit price of 1.2050. This means that when the market price reaches 1.2000, your order will become active and try to buy EUR/USD at 1.2050 or lower. However, if the market price jumps above 1.2050 before your order is executed, your order will not be filled.</p> <p>You can use a stop limit order to protect your profits or limit your losses on an existing position, or to enter a new position at a specific price range. To do this, you need to use the FCLite library, which is a Java package that connects to the trading platform's API.</p> <p>To add a stop limit order to a position or an order, you need to follow these steps: 1. Create a session object. 1. Create a Session object that allows you to connect to the server and log in with your credentials. 2. Create an OpenPositionsManager object that allows you to manage the open positions. 3. Create an OrdersManager object that allows you to manage the orders. Creating these objects is simple as you can see below.</p> TYPESCRIPT <p>``` typescript</p> <p>let openPositionsManager = session.getOpenPositionsManager(); // get open positions manager let ordersManager = session.getOrdersManager(); // get orders manager     ```</p> JAVASCRIPT <p>``` JavaScript</p> <p>let openPositionsManager = session.getOpenPositionsManager(); // get open positions manager let ordersManager = session.getOrdersManager(); // get orders manager     ```</p> <ol> <li>Add order change listeners to the OpenPositionsManager and OrdersManager objects to handle the events related to the orders and positions.</li> </ol> TYPESCRIPT <p>``` typescript</p> <p>const orderChangeListener = new OrderChangeListener(ordersManager, openPositionsManager); //create listener on the two created managers session.getOrdersManager().subscribeOrderChange(orderChangeListener); //attach the listener to the session object to make it active.     ```</p> JAVASCRIPT <p>``` JavaScript</p> <p>let orderChangeListener = new OrderChangeListener(ordersManager, openPositionsManager); //create listener on the two created managers session.getOrdersManager().subscribeOrderChange(orderChangeListener); //attach the listener to the session object to make it active.     ```</p> <p>See also IOpenPositionsManager, IOrdersManager, subscribeOrderChange</p> <p>Get the ID of the position or order that you want to attach a stop limit order to. You can use the GetPositions or GetOrders methods of the Session object to retrieve the positions or orders. Specify the parameters of the stop limit order, such as the stop price, the limit price, and the quantity. The stop price is the price at which the stop limit order will be triggered. The limit price is the price at which the stop limit order will be executed. The quantity is the number of contracts or shares to trade. Below you can see some example code for creating the listeners that are used above:</p> TYPESCRIPT <p>``` typescript</p> <p>class OrderChangeListener implements FXConnectLite.IOrderChangeListener {     constructor(private ordersManager: FXConnectLite.IOrdersManager, private openPositionsManager: FXConnectLite.IOpenPositionsManager) {</p> <pre><code>}\nonChange(orderInfo) {\n    const order = this.ordersManager.getOrderById(orderInfo.getOrderId());\n    Printer.print(`changed order ${orderInfo.getOrderId()} status ${order.getStatus()}`);\n}\nonAdd(orderInfo) {\n    const order = this.ordersManager.getOrderById(orderInfo.getOrderId());\n    Printer.print(\"added order, id = \" + orderInfo.getOrderId()+ \", type = \" + order.getType());\n    if(order.getTradeId() != null &amp; (order.getType() == \"L\" || order.getType() == \"S\")) {\n        let openPosition = this.openPositionsManager.getOpenPosition(order.getTradeId());\n        Printer.print(`OpenPosition ${order.getTradeId()} changed.
