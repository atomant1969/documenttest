Here are the main steps that you need to follow:</p> <p>Create a configuration file for FCLite API, which contains the information about the server URL, the access token, the log level, and the log file path. You can use the sample configuration file provided by Gehtsoft USA LLC here: https://docs.gehtsoftusa.com/fclite/#configuration.html Load the configuration file in your code using the FCLite API methods for your language. For example, if you use C++, you can use the method FXCM::Config::load(const char* fileName) to load the configuration file from a given file name. Create a session object for FCLite API, which represents a connection to the FXCM trading platform. You can use the FCLite API methods for your language to create and manage the session object. For example, if you use C++, you can use the method FXCM::Session::create() to create a session object.

It has two parts: a stop price and a limit price. The stop price is the level that activates the order. The limit price is the level that executes the order.</p> <p>For example, suppose you want to buy EUR/USD at 1.2000, but you don't want to pay more than 1.2050. You can place a stop limit order with a stop price of 1.2000 and a limit price of 1.2050. This means that when the market price reaches 1.2000, your order will become active and try to buy EUR/USD at 1.2050 or lower. However, if the market price jumps above 1.2050 before your order is executed, your order will not be filled.</p> <p>You can use a stop limit order to protect your profits or limit your losses on an existing position, or to enter a new position at a specific price range.
